## 1) Why are you interested in Programming?  
>##I love how you can create beautiful responsive websites and apps with the new programming languages.  I am a geek at heart and have been more on the fix and repair side of computers and mobile devices. I realize I need to learn the programming side of computer technology to enhance my skill set. I learned some HTML back in the late 1997. I've created wordpress websites, but there are limits to your creativity. 

## 1a) What have you done to expose yourself to programming so far?
>## I started searching the internet for more information about programming. I was curious to see if it was something I could do as a career. I found FreeCodeCamp.com I signed up in Oct. 8th, 2016 and  I was able to complete 264 challenges in about 2 months. These were 8-10 hours a day 5-6 days. I was amazed at myself how well I did! I was enjoying the challenges. *The ending of Oct. 31st, 2016  I was listening to a podcast from The Mentoring Developers and the guest on episode 49 was a graduate from Ada Academy named Liz Rush and now a Software Developer working as a Freelancer. This got me interested to find out more information about Ada Academy, so here I am excited to have this opportunity to apply for Ada Academy, thank you. *

##2) What are your Professional goals for the next 5 years?
>## I will build a strong network of Software Developers with Ada Academy colleagues and my internship work environment with one of their well established  technology organizations. My 5 year goal will involve growing with the company where I can continue to learn, take on additional responsibilities and contribute as much value as I can. This company will have emphasizes on Professional development goals.  



##3) How will you contribute to Ada's vision for inclusive and diverse community?

I will help non-profit and for profit organizations with a better understanding how to increase their revenue using responsive, interactive websites and apps. Demonstrate easier ways for fundraising their causes, excepting donations,  easy access, better communications, quick support, training and volunteer sign ups. 

##4) Tell us about the last time you made a mistake and you learned a lot from?
>## I was a Returns Cashier with Home Depot. This customer came in to return a faucet, he said it did not fit his kitchen sink and nothing was wrong with it. I looked inside the box , scanned the box and refunded the customer. When the plumbing associate came to pickup his returns for plumbing department, he indicated it was not the same faucet that came in the box. My mistake to assumed it was the same faucet as the box. I learn a lot my from my mistake, I need to update my knowledge of our products which is very important and check with the department associates. 


##4a) If you encountered this situation again, what would you do differently?
>## I spoke to the manager and asked him how do I avoid this mistake in the future? He indicated I should keep learning our products and when I am unsure or also on high price items, please call the associate for the department or a Manager. I understand how important it was to keep our returns accurate and loss prevention down.
